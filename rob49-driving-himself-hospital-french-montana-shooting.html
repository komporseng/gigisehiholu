So I’m like, ‘Oh it’s the time.'”</p><p>He continued: “I drove myself to that bitch. I hopped in somebody car…I drove myself to the hospital cause they had a n-gga in the driver’s seat. I jumped in anybody car. I grabbed this n-gga’s wheel and pressed his leg down. Took his phone, put his maps on, went to the hospital. I said alright, we pulled up to the hospital.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I got shot in my back by my lungs so I’m like, fuck, can’t play them type games.

I said brother we’re going on the sidewalk, boom … stuffed his leg again, we on the sidewalk.”</p><p>Rob went on to say that after blowing out all four tires on the sidewalk, he was able to finally get to the hospital, only to have the staff send him back to the other hospital he was just at.</p><p></p><p>Back in January, <a class=underline-link href=#>Rob49 was among 10 people shot during a gathering with French Montana in Miami, Florida</a>.

I saw [reports] that it was a music video and I was like alright I’m not even about to clear that up.”</p><p>He continued, “Listen, man I done been through a lot. That’s not half of the shit I done been through. That’s some shit we went through at home like 100 times. The world just got a chance to see it because I got a platform but it ain’t nothing like that to me. I’m just going on my music, that’s all I’m really thinking about. I’m focusing on this drop.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Rob49 is gearing up to drop his new album&nbsp;4 God II.
