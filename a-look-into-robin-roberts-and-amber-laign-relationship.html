As we prepare to ring in the new year, I am thankful for my complete family, my long-term partner, Amber, and our friends.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Robin-Roberts-1.jpg alt="Robin Roberts" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Roberts confessed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2014 why she had not spoken publicly about Amber despite the fact that they had been dating since 2005.</p><p>She said, ”</p><p>“Not everyone wants to be the center of attention. She’s been there for me every step of the way, and she’s really supportive.”</p><p>Amber Laign is a massage therapist and the co-founder of Plant Juice Oils, a women’s wellness product line. Robin Roberts and Amber have two homes: the host’s opulent Manhattan apartment near her GMA studio, and a Connecticut property where they live while Roberts is not filming for the program.&nbsp;Amber, whose Instagram account is secret, came to the site in 2020 and published a photo reminiscing about their first meeting in 2005. According to Hello Magazine, she stated:</p><p>“I met you for cocktails 15 years ago on a blind date that both of us attempted to cancel… twice. Your elegance immediately drew my attention, and the easiness of the evening lasted through supper. We went on another date shortly after, and I couldn’t believe how comfortable I felt with you as we talked our lives while drinking lychee and apple martinis.”</p><p>Amber and Robin are both cancer survivors. Roberts was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 and eventually became Amber’s carer.&nbsp;Laign was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021, and Robin announced the news online in early 2022. Robin Roberts issued a video on October 24, 2022, thanking fans for their well-wishes for Laign’s recovery.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Robin-Roberts-2.jpg alt="Robin Roberts" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She stated:</p><p>“We just wanted to say thank you for your continuing prayers, and we will return them tenfold.
