She passed away on the scene.</span></span></p><p><span><span>First responders arrived around 9:45 PM on December 21st after receiving reports of the devastating accident near Albatross Road. According to highway patrol, a northbound Ford F-150 veered into the rear of Pack’s 2024 moped as it overturned from the collision impact.</span></span></p><p><span><strong><span>“The tremendous force of the truck slamming into the moped caused it to flip, fatally injuring the female passenger,” said patrol sergeant Tim Morgan.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;The male moped driver survived with severe injuries and was rushed to the hospital by first responders.</span></span></p><p><span><span>A makeshift memorial now lines SC-183 where Pack heartbreakingly perished a week before Christmas, leaving five grieving children without their doting mother. As her loved ones plan an upcoming memorial service, the Pickens County community mourns right alongside them.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Born October 2nd, 1993 in Easley, South Carolina to parents Scottie Hamilton and Angela Kelley, Kerry Pack radiated light and joy through all her days, however numbered far too few. Music was her passion – Pack “especially loved her children, her sisters and hanging out with her friends,” reads her obituary.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>That love shone brightly as a devoted mom to five kids – Karlee, Chazlee, Cameron, Adriana and Ryland. Pack’s family describes her as “a free spirit” who could also light up any room with her humor and generosity.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Tragically, Pack perished unexpectedly in her prime, forced to leave her precious babies behind without their caring mother’s guidance. Yet her luminous legacy shall not fade even in physical absence. May Kerry Pack’s vibrant memory live on through the children she cherished most.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Seeking Justice, Promoting Road Safety</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>As the holiday season continues casting gloom over an inconsolable family, SC Highway Patrol diligently investigates the exact circumstances of Pack’s heartbreaking moped crash. They are currently working to determine negligence or any charges against the Ford pickup driver who triggered this fatal collision. Troopers implore the community to drive safely and remain alert to prevent such needless tragedies.</span></span></span></p><p><span><strong><span><span>“We send deepest condolences to all who loved Kerry Pack during this agonizing time,” said Sgt. Morgan, echoing his department’s profound wishes to support victims through justice and awareness.</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;“Please honor her memory by driving attentively – your caution could save precious lives.”</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>For now, Pickens County rallies around Pack’s grieving loved ones, offering compassion through indescribable hardship. Though the days ahead emerge bleak and challenging, may the community’s strength uplift them.</span></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkaq0qq3OrKZyZZKZe6aw1Getp2ebmr%2BzxYypmJyjXaSvqsDUmqmyZZWWwK2x2GaqnGWRo7Fut8SrqbJloJawrHnEmqqlnaliwKR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
