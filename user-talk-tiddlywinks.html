EU/AUS and JP locations? If anyone seeing this can provide me a list of all the locations for an EU/AUS or JP 3DS, preferably checked against an actual EU/AUS or JP 3DS (with its language set to English...if possible?) and preferably with all the same letter accents (like í, á, ã, ñ, etc) as in the 3DS, I'd be very grateful. If not, eventually I'll go looking for people myself, but if anyone's possibly got a list already, then I'd rather not trouble others for the task."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It doesn't give you what region their 3DS is from but it's at least a start. <a href=# title=User:Glik>Glik</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Glik">talk</a>) 23:25, 7 January 2014 (UTC) Yeah, I just happened to notice that on passerby today. It'd be a slow and complicated start, though. I'll probably try to ask people with foreign 3DS's before I try that. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 02:10, 8 January 2014 (UTC) Went through and added all the EU locations, hoping there's no typos but with 69 countries, about 750 individual locations and so many odd spellings I wouldn't be surprised if one or two slipped in... Surprisingly enough, apparently there's even a town called Batman in Turkey. <a href=# class=new title="User:Bluesun (page does not exist)">Bluesun</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Bluesun">talk</a>) 17:30, 22 January 2014 (UTC)<h2><span class=mw-headline id=South_Korea>South Korea</span></h2><p>Tiddlywinks, you forgot to add South Korea since a South Korean gamer found a Continental Pattern Vivillon. <a href=# title=User:Cinday123><span>Cinday123</span></a> <i>(<a href=# title="User talk:Cinday123"><span>Talk</span></a>)</i> 01:44, 7 January 2014 (UTC)</p>There are a lot of locations not on there. Like everywhere in Europe. I don't intend to add just one or two countries, though, especially when I can't be 100% sure which region they belong to. Like I said in the section above, what I really want is a list from someone with a non-NA 3DS, a list of all the locations their 3DS can be set to. Then I'll be happy to update, when I can add a whole and complete region. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 02:43, 7 January 2014 (UTC)<h2><span class=mw-headline id=hey>hey</span></h2><p>very nice stuff, good sir. One day i would love to see the full world map all coloured out, even tho if some countries are left out but some places can be obvious like Cuba for Archipelgo. <a href=# title=User:Jason><span>-Mew Jadester</span></a><a href=# title="User talk:Jason"><span>-tp-</span></a> 13:43, 2 February 2014 (UTC) Hey tiddlywinks, its me again, i have used those extracted data you have gathered and i am working on to fill in all the gaps, its going pretty nicely. I will personally upload the map image (that would be all complete) and the data i have gathered. Its a shame that the owner of imgur have taken down the survey part so im left in the dark to finish it off myself anywwayts (not that bothers me since i dont have anything better to do and im knowledgable in geography) If u wanna contact me faster to get it, feel free to email me at mew.jadester (at) gmail.com. Cheers. <a href=# title=User:Jason><span>-Mew Jadester</span></a><a href=# title="User talk:Jason"><span>-tp-</span></a> 13:32, 3 February 2014 (UTC)</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Official_maps>Official maps</span></h2><p>Here are the Vivillon maps from the official Japanese guidebook, thanks to bluesun. <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>Page set 1</a>, <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>Page set 2</a>. I have them in higher resolution if you want, but this is the maximum size for the Archives. --<a href=# title=User:SnorlaxMonster><span><b>Snorlax</b></span></a><a href=# title="User talk:SnorlaxMonster"><span><b>Monster</b></span></a> 01:00, 3 March 2014 (UTC)</p>If you could give me dropbox links to those higher resolution pages, I'd be happy to just cut out the map portions to have them at higher res. I imagine that would fit alright in the Archives. (Unless you'd like to do that yourself.) <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 01:29, 3 March 2014 (UTC)<h2><span class=mw-headline id=Duplicate_Entry>Duplicate Entry</span></h2><p>First off I want to say that this table looks great and it's greatly helped with my interest in the Vivillon patterns/locations. But I believe you have a duplicate sublocation under Dominican Republic (Elias Pina) which is also throwing off your counts by one. <a href=# class=new title="User:SuperSmole (page does not exist)">SuperSmole</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:SuperSmole">talk</a>) 02:53, 9 January 2015 (UTC)</p>You're right. I'm not sure at this point, but I think I copied a bunch of locations from somewhere that closely matched 3DS locations, and then tried to check my American locations, but I guess I missed that duplicate. Or something. =P Thanks! <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 03:08, 9 January 2015 (UTC)<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4rApr6%2BrZilo2qJtqWwy7KuoqabqHyXtdWio6WnnpS5sK%2FAraCopqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
