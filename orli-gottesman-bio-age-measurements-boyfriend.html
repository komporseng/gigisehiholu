Keep reading this Orli Gottesman Bio to get acquainted.</span></p><h3><b>Orli Gottesman On Yellowstone</b></h3><p><i><span>Yellowstone</span></i><span> season 5 was a total disappointment for some as fans were introduced to a much-older looking Carter (portrayed by Finn Little). However, actress Orli Gottesman came to the rescue as a confident and outgoing girl named “Halie” who captured Carter’s attention.</span></p><p><span>“[Halie] will keep him kind of like a little bit outside of the darkest parts of what happens on the ranch,” Orli talked a little about her character. However, she also noted that no relationship was ever simple in the series. Their romance will “100 percent” be a roller coaster of emotions, “because nothing’s easy,” the actress added.</span></p><p><span>Also, Orli said, “I think there’s some connection between Halie and Carter … this little crush [that] gets their hearts going, [gives them] butterflies in their stomach.”</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Orli’s character was reported to act as a buffer between any hardships among Rip, Beth, and Carter.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking a little about behind-the-scenes, Orli said that she used to read a script and do the scenes over and over again because portraying “Halie” was tough. “Some roles are harder than others depending on the relatability I have to the character,” she explained.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Orli Gottesman Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Orli Gottesman garnered a net worth of above $300 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span>So far, she’s graced over 8 movies and TV shows including </span><i><span>Adeline</span></i><span> (2022), </span><i><span>207 </span></i><span>(2020), </span><i><span>Discover Indie Flim</span></i><span> (2020), </span><i><span>Still Dreaming</span></i><span> (2019), </span><i><span>Beast </span></i><span>(2018), and </span><i><span>Cattle Call </span></i><span>(2017).</span></p><p><span>But though important, the number is nothing compared to what Orli has acted in commercials. Infact, Orli began modeling at the age of 5 and has booked numerous television commercials for Florida Power & Light, Commerce Bank, Burger King, and more.</span></p><p><span>And it was only after she and her sister had the opportunity to go to Los Angles for an actor’s showcase for about 2 weeks to act, take classes and even do a short film, she got bit the acting bug. It was total a “Hollywood” experience — with a premiere, a red carpet, and photographers. Of course, Orli wanted in!</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, she started auditioning for shows and got rejected quite a few times. But knowing every experience was only bringing her closer to my goal, she stayed positive with every disappointment.</span></p><p><span>No wonder, her most rewarding part of work was the “satisfaction and relief” of when she books something.</span></p><p><span>In 2022, she was represented by </span><i><span>Mincks Talent Management</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Osbrink Commercial and Prin</span></i><span>t, and </span><i><span>Osbrink Theatrical Division</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>When Orli isn’t acting, she loves to snowboard and play tennis (competitively as well).</span></p><h3><b>Orli Gottesman Age</b></h3><p><span>Orli Gottesman was 16 years of age when she appeared in </span><i><span>Yellowstone</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She is 6 months older than her </span><i><span>Yellowstone</span></i><span> co-actor Finn Little.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Orli Gottesman Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Orli Gottesman was born to her parents, Oren and Lisa J Gottesman. They were married on October 22, 2001 — four years before Orli was born.</span></p><p><span>His dad, Oren Gottesman was born on May 1971. He has a bachelor’s degree from the University of California and today works as a managing member of his own company </span><i><span>Hadas LLC</span></i><span>. Also, as of 2022, he is involved with </span><i><span>Juice Plus</span></i><span>, and Total </span><i><span>Care Property Management of SW Florida, LLC</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the past, Oren also spent a few years as a Real Estate Broker.</span></p><p><span>As for her mother, Lisa was born on Feb 1968. She went to </span><i><span>West Valley College</span></i><span> and worked as an ICON Agent at </span><i><span>eXp Realty</span></i><span>. Overall, she described herself as a “mom, wife, animal lover, lifelong learner, and quantum traveler striving to be a conscientious loving human.”</span></p><p><span>Talking about her siblings, Orli has a sister named <a href=#>Arielle Gottesman</a> who’s also an actress. You might have seen her in Girls’ Night In 92021), </span><i><span>207 </span></i><span>(2020), </span><i><span>Discover Indie Flim</span></i><span> (2020), </span><i><span>Still Dreaming</span></i><span> (2019), and </span><i><span>Beast </span></i><span>(2018).</span></p><p><span>Like her sister, Orli also started modeling in Miami, Florida when she was just 7 years old, working for many European clothing companies.</span></p><p><span>Here’s her IG @</span><a href=#><span>ariellegottesman</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> When Orli was introduced to acting through a party, at her first job, she kept asking her mother when the party was going to start.</span></p><h3><b>Orli Gottesman Measurements</b></h3><p><span>At the age of 16, Orli Gottesman stood tall at a height of 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) and weighed 59 kg (130 lbs).</span></p><p><span>More of her body measurements weren’t revealed.</span></p><p><span>Her distinct features include — long brown hair, brown eyes, and a fit body.</span></p><h3><b>Orli Gottesman Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span>Orli Gottesman didn’t talk about her boyfriend. Maybe because she was too young to have one or she was more focused on her work, the actress didn’t seem to be interested in talking about romance either.</span></p><p><span>As for her on-screen boyfriend, he’s the Australian actor Finn Little. He is best recognized for having played the titular character in the 2019 feature film</span><i><span> Storm Boy</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Orli Gottesman From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Orli hails from Fort Meyers, Florida.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Orli Gottesman Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Orli receives her birthday wishes on December 4.
