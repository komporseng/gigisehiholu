When moderator France inquired about her relationship status, Chrishell Stause talked about her connection with G Flip.&nbsp;She said that she had spent time with “someone essential,” whose name is G-Flip. The great musician is non-binary, and they/them are their preferred pronouns. The Selling Sunset star participated in one of their music videos and even tattooed “Get me outta here” on G-Flip.</p><p>When asked about their relationship, she stated:</p><p>“I was just going to appear in their video. It’s about this tumultuous love tale. And, you know, I came from soap operas, I love acting, and with our profession, I don’t always get to do it. So, of course, at first I said, “Yes, let’s do that.”</p><p>They were recently seen together at one of the most exclusive celebrity Halloween parties, Casamigos.</p><h2>Chrishell Stause of Selling Sunset and G Flip initially met on Halloween 2021.</h2><p>Chrishell from Selling Sunset attended the Casamigos Halloween party on October 28th, 2022. She dressed as a seductive skeleton, while her companion, G Flip, dressed as a terrifying rocker with a “Jack Skellington” half-smile.&nbsp;They first met last year on Halloween when each was with their respective ex-boyfriends. Stause was dating her employer and co-star Jason Oppenheim at the time, with whom she parted because they didn’t agree on having children in the future.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chrishell-Stause-1.jpg alt="Chrishell Stause" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Chrishell then starred in G Flip’s GET ME OUTTA HERE music video in May 2022, and the two have been inseparable ever since then. On May 10, the Selling Sunset actress went to Instagram to declare her relationship with the musician in order to assist her followers to understand gender identity a bit better.</p><p>In the video, she defined her partner’s pronouns, saying:</p><p>“They identify as both male and female. So there’s one of those things that I think is a lovely combination.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chrishell-Stause.png alt="Chrishell Stause" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>G then said that they envisage children in their future with Stause. They believe that having children would help to mainstream same-sex relationships, but they also state that the couple is not there yet. G Flip was a music instructor for many years before becoming a drummer, and then a solo musician.&nbsp;The pair went on a trip together lately and also attended the MTV Movie & TV Awards: UNSCRIPTED. Chrishell received the Best Reality Star award and thanked her followers for their support of her relationship in her acceptance speech.&nbsp;The two often express their love for one another on social media, and in September, the Selling Sunset actress celebrated her partner’s birthday with a sweet image and praised them for their “kind true heart.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmabmKe2tLTEpaNmq6SWwrSxjJqlnWWXYrOttc9mqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
