I’ve watched it happen. We’ve lost more than 20 million black babies over the last 40 years. That’s 40% of my race exterminated before given a chance to bless our nation with their innate talent.”</p><p>Owens was specifically taking issue with a statement last week from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who sparked outrage by suggesting restricting abortion would be bad for the economy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MSNBC COLUMNIST: MEN SHOULD GET ‘VASECTOMIES’ IN RESPONSE TO ‘EXTREME RIGHT-WING MINORITY RULE GOVERNMENT’</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/04/640/320/burgess-owens-GETTY.jpg><p>Burgess Owens, R-Utah., speaks during a news conference with other House Republican members on immigration in Washington March 17, 2021.&nbsp;<br><span class=copyright>(Getty Images)</span></p><p>“Since I’m very aware of the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, I find the parroting of her manifesto by Secretary Yellen … the devaluation of life of unborn poor Black and minority children as very concerning,” Owens added. “I’m also aware of Sanger’s 1946 book, ‘The Negro Project,’ in which she shared her vision for poor Blacks and other minorities. And I quote, ‘The gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extinction of defective stock … those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.'”</p><p>Owens also referenced an op-ed from Sen. Tim Scott in which the South Carolina Republican also took issue with Yellen’s comment with the headline, “Abortion is not the way to help single Black mothers.”</p><p>“Thank goodness Sen. Tim Scott, upon hearing this statement by Secretary Yellen, called this out for what it was — biased, callous and calculated,” Owens said. “I agree with my friend Sen. Scott, who learned from his single mother that ‘there is dignity in all work and dignity in all life.’”</p><p><strong>ROE V.
