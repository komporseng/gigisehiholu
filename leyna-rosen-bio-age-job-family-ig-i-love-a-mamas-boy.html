Take a look at Leyna Rosen. Even when her boyfriend Ethan describes his mother Esther as “hot and sexy,” and wants her to be naked while walking him down the aisle for his wedding, Leyna was trying relentlessly to be the main lady in her man’s life.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep reading this Leyna Rosen Bio to learn more about this strong lady.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>I Love A Mama’s Boy: Are Leyna Rosen And Ethan Weisman Still Together?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, as of June 2022, Leyna Rosen and Ethan Weisman are still together. The last we saw them was on June 6 at their friends Liza Weisman and Bentlee Birchansky’s wedding.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So when will the lovebirds themselves be getting married? Well, Leyna revealed that she had “one more year” in September 2021. So, perhaps, the duo planned to tie the knot in September 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Looking at the start, Leyna and Ethan began their love story at least in July 2018. Thereafter, the two started traveling around the world including Rome, Italy; Ocho Rios, Jamaica, and more. And in July 2020, Ethan then popped the question to the love of his life (Well, to the second love of his life to be precise).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Excited to spend the rest of my life with you @leynarosen,” Ethan post a pic from their engagement over IG. Likewise,&nbsp; Leyna took it to her IG to share the same pics captioned, “A dream come true🤍”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, for now, all we can do is wait for the duo’s love story to progress. And since we know that the two are still together, it also means that Leyna has come to a mutual understanding with her future mother-in-law. Guess, she’s finally made peace with her jealousy. Or perhaps, there’s a whole another story.
