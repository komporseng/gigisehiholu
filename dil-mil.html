The app boasts a history of over 20 million matches already created. With over two million singles with a profile, the application's small community still provides many opportunities to find a partner.</p><p>Dil Mil is one of many dating apps that uses the popular swipe mechanic to match with other people. If you're looking for a partner, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Tinder</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Bumble</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>OkCupid</a> are other great alternatives. Dil Mil isn't focused on hookups or arranged marriages and instead, promotes a <strong>safe space</strong> for men and women to find potential life partners.</p><h3>Meet South Asians singles</h3><p>Dil Mil is an app <strong>designed for South Asian singles</strong>, so it boasts a tight-knit community of this one ethnicity. With over two million users online, the application is filled with users ready to match.&nbsp;</p><h3>Interface</h3><p>The Dil Mil app uses an interface that displays each <strong>user's picture and name</strong>, similar to most alternatives. However, the interface is difficult to navigate at times.&nbsp;</p><h3>Your profile</h3><p>As you use the app and <strong>create a profile</strong>, you'll need to complete a series of tasks to stand out. Editing your bio requires you to answer a series of prompts, including your height, age, and gender. You'll also need to upload a picture of yourself to complete your profile.</p><h3>VIP Elite</h3><p><strong>VIP Elite</strong> is the <strong>premium subscription</strong> for Dil Mil. The service requires a monthly subscription cost and will automatically renew unless it’s canceled.&nbsp;</p><p>This hefty fee comes with many <strong>in-app features</strong>. These features include instant matches, boosts, unlimited likes, the option to go back on swipes, and a way to change your location. These features provide an easier way to find a match and start talking with other users quickly.</p><h3>Our take</h3><p>Dil Mil has a smaller community than many other dating apps on the market. However, the small community isn't a negative aspect, as it's focused solely on South Asians, providing a meeting place and a way to find others quickly. However, the database of users isn't tiny; with <strong>over two million users online</strong>, a potential match is just a swipe away.</p><h3>Should you download it?</h3><p>Yes. If you're specifically looking for South Asian singles, this app is a great option to install over any others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn6y7rbvAnapnnJmctrWty62pnqaUqHuku8xom6KkXaK2rXvAp5urp5mZ</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
