Meat is one of many grocery staples that has skyrocketed in price amid the pandemic. Demand went through the roof as more Americans began to cook at home, and labor shortages and production delays have subsequently sparked shortages and heftier price tags."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Demand went through the roof as more Americans began to cook at home, and labor shortages and production delays have subsequently sparked shortages and heftier price tags.</p><p>But Costco has several meat options on sale right now, which helps if you’re trying to keep your grocery bill low amid record inflation. Without further ado, here are seven types of meat you can get for cheap at the warehouse chain right now. (And for more, here are 6 Things You’ll See at Costco This Year.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/media/images/ext/344784192/roasted-pork-tenderloin.jpg><p>This is an example of a type of meat that follows the “more you buy, the more you save” trend. According to Instacart, Costco has pork tenderloin options ranging in price from $2.48 to $6.21 a pound. Since Costco sells items in bulk, you get a lot in each pack—at least a few pounds! If you compare that to current prices at Target (about $5 a pound) and Walmart (about $4 a pound or more), buying pork tenderloin at Costco is a good deal right now.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png alt="Eat this, not that" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><br>To get all the latest Costco news delivered right to your email inbox every day, sign up for our newsletter!<br><span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png><p>Thanks to frequent sales, there’s likely to be an item on your grocery shopping list that is cheaper at Costco. Included in the most recent round of Member-Only Savings are two Amylu meat products: 46-ounce boxes of Teriyaki & Pineapple Chicken Meatballs and 2.5-pound packs of Antibiotic-Free Chicken Breakfast Sausage Links. Both are $3.50 off until Feb. 27<span>—</span>and the meatballs are on this list of dietitian-approved food items.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/02/amylu-teriyaki-pineapple-chicken-meatballs.jpg><p>As if one option wasn’t enough, another Teriyaki & Pineapple Chicken Meatball variety is on sale for $3.50 off at Costco right now. The Aidells version (also 46 ounces) is “very tasty,” according to one reviewer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/02/Aidells-Teriyaki-Pineapple-Chicken-Meatballs.jpg><p>Bringing home the bacon is cheaper right now, thanks to Costco. The 3-pound thick-cut variety from the warehouse chain’s Kirkland Signature brand is $15.49, or about $5.16 a pound. That’s cheaper than similar options at Sam’s Club, Target, and Walmart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/02/Costco-Kirkand-Signature-Bacon.jpg><p><span>An impressive </span>106 million chickens were sold<span> at Costco last year—</span>a record for the warehouse chain. Meat prices are climbing as supermarkets struggle with inflation and supply chain issues. However, t<span>he tags on Costco rotisserie chickens have read $4.99 since 2009</span>.</p><p>Like other meat selections at Costco, the rotisserie chicken is hefty, meaning you wind up with enough meat to stretch across several meals. For some inspiration, here are more than 45 soup and chili recipes you can make using a Costco rotisserie chicken, plus 6 ways to dress one up, according to chefs and experts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/Costco-Rotisserie-Chicken.jpg><p>One of the benefits of buying ground beef in bulk at Costco? You don’t have to worry about paying more for another pound next week if the price goes up. Plus, this pack of ground beef is separated into 1-pound sections, making it easy to freeze and store what you’re not using for a later date. Right now, you can get it at Costco or on the chain’s website for around $15.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/02/Costco-Halal-100-Pure-Ground-Beef-Hamburger.jpg><p>During the savings event taking place right now at warehouses and online, you can also take $5 off a 3-pound bag of Kirkland Signature Farm Raised Atlantic Salmon. Though Costco members recently noticed changes to the nutrition label, this fish has more than 30 grams of protein per serving. There’s nothing fishy about this deal.</p><p>Before you head to the warehouse, don’t forget to check out the <strong>5 Costco Changes Members Need to Know About Right Now</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vCqKqtm59itaK%2FjK2fnquVYoRuwNipnKxln5t6rrHArWSfp6JisKmxwKlkq6GXncFuus6wZJ6ZpGLBqbXSZqWorF2ptaLAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
