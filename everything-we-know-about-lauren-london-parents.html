Previous music videos for musicians like Ludacris and Tyrese featured London as a model. Before starring with rapper T.I. in ATL, she made her on-screen debut in an episode of Everybody Hates Chris.</strong></p><p>Before securing a recurring role in the BET series The Game, London made a number of brief television and cinema appearances. Her most recent appearance on television was in the 2019 season of Games People Play on BET.</p><h2>Where was Lauren London born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</h2><p>Lauren was born on <strong>December 5, 1984</strong>, to a Jewish father and an African-American mother. When Lauren was three years old, her parents separated, which marked the beginning of her identity issue.</p><p>While her white friends made fun of her race when she visited her father, London’s maternal cousins teased her for “not being black enough.”</p><p>Lauren eventually discovered how to be at ease in her own flesh, though. To Kathleen Cross, she said:</p><p>“If someone feels that I’m not enough black, that’s their problem. I accept who I am and accept the situation as it is. I share my mother’s race as a Black lady, and I cherish both of my halves. I won’t put up with that anymore, so no one makes a big deal about it anymore.</p><h2>Lauren London considers herself “saved” by raising her two sons</h2><p>Lauren is quite private about her parents, but she has shared how having children has changed her. London has two sons, Ermias Asghedom and Kameron Carter, from her relationships with Nipsey Hussle and Lil Wayne, respectively.</p><p>Lauren shared a picture of her kid and her on <strong>May 10, 2020</strong>, and wrote in the caption that becoming a mother “saved her.” The utmost Honor to be their mother, she penned. I’ve been saved by this love. To all the mothers: peace. Mother’s Day greetings.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Look Inside Shannon Thornton’s Secret Love Life</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Cariba Heine- Everything You Need To Know About Her</a></h3>Talented actress Cariba Heine is best known for her performances in Blue Water High and H2O: Just Add Water.
