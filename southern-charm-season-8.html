After being arrested and pleading guilty to assault charges in 2018, Thomas Ravenel also left the show.</p><p>Despite losing some big names, Southern Charm has kept the drama high, and owing to the additions of Austen Kroll and his ex-girlfriend Madison LeCroy, fans are still tuning in to see what happens next. Fans got to meet John Pringle and Cameran’s companion Leva Bonaparte last season.</p><p>However, when it comes to Season 8, the performers have hinted that more upheaval is on the way.</p><p>Craig and Austen made news in late 2020 for their friendship with Kristin Cavallari, and the lawyer told Us Weekly exclusively that Cavallari could appear on the reality show.</p><p>Craig stated in April 2021, “It’s not ruled out at all.” “Yeah, if [she and her BFF Justin Anderson] are at the party.” I believe you’ll get to see a good number of our pals from the last six months, which will be a lot of fun.”</p><p>For her part, the Laguna Beach alum told Us that she had no intentions to appear in the film.</p><p>“They say ‘never say never,’ but I can certainly say I’ll never do Southern Charm,” Cavallari told Us exclusively the same month. “Craig is my favourite. I’m not sure! I’m not sure why he was saying that.”</p><p>Craig’s girlfriend, Paige DeSorbo, and some of their Winter House cast mates may join for an episode or two, though the Hills alum isn’t planning another Charleston visit just yet.</p><p>Craig told Us in October 2021 that “Bravo is kind of the new Marvel world [with] everyone becoming buddies,” implying that a crossover on Southern Charm could happen. “I think everyone who enjoys watching it has some pretty exciting stuff coming up in the next few months.”</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cameras-Rolling-Southern-Charm-Season-8-Everything-We-Know-001.jpg alt width=700 height=371 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Who’s In?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Naomie Olindo Is Back!</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Will Paige DeSorbo Make an Appearance?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> ‘Winter House’ Drama?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> How Madison LeCroy’s Fiance’s Family Feels About Their Engagement</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Relationship Updates</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Filming Has Begun</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Keeping Things Light</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> The Naomie/Craig Factor</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> It’s a Wrap</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> Craig’s Post-Filming Tease</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> How Many Episodes Will There Be?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">13</span> Season 8 Trailer</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Whos_In>Who’s In?</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Winter-House-Trailer-Teases-Austens-Love-Triangle-With-Ciara-and-Lindsay-Kyle-Flirting-and-New-Bravo-Stars-Paige-DeSorbo.jpg alt width=700 height=1049 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Shep, Kathryn, and Craig are set to return, according to Bravo’s cast roster.

Can we be friends because we’re truly friends and people enjoy to watch us being friends?’ And I think a lot of people have that perspective,” he said, adding that in season 8, spectators will watch his beer adventure continue on television.</p><h3><span id=The_NaomieCraig_Factor>The Naomie/Craig Factor</span></h3><p>Craig revealed how his girlfriend is surviving following her ugly breakup from Metul during his interview on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in October 2021.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Why-Fans-Think-the-Southern-Charm-Season-8-Wrap-Party-Divided-the-Cast-3.jpg alt width=700 height=472 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>“She’s been overjoyed. He remarked, “I think she’s relieved in an odd sense.” “She’s glad to be back in Charleston, and everything happens for a reason.” I don’t believe she was in a happy relationship. But I think she’s just relieved to be back in her own skin.”</p><p>Austen was asked the following night on WWHL if there had been any “sparks” between Craig and Naomie since she returned to Charleston. “This is something that’s being discussed on Southern Charm, and we’re filming right now, so I won’t and can’t talk about it,” he replied.</p><h3><span id=Its_a_Wrap>It’s a Wrap</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gallery-Update-Southern-Charm-Season-8-Everything-Know-austen.jpg alt width=700 height=700 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>In December 2021, Leva posted a photo to her Instagram Story revealing that filming for Season 8 has wrapped after a winter wrap party. Following the party, the restaurateur raised a few eyebrows when she unfollowed Kathryn, Craig, Austen, Madison, Venita Aspen, and Paige.</p><h3><span id=Craigs_Post-Filming_Tease>Craig’s Post-Filming Tease</span></h3><p>Craig guaranteed that season 8 will provide the same enthusiasm as the series’ early years during an interview on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in March 2022. He also stated that he was “a strong supporter” of his ex-girlfriend Naomie’s homecoming.</p><p>“She apologised to everyone she needed to apologise to. And she uttered all that everyone had wished she would say to me. And it’s fantastic. She expressed regret. And he was forthright about it,” he stated. “It brings it all together, and I believe people will love this season.”</p><h3><span id=How_Many_Episodes_Will_There_Be>How Many Episodes Will There Be?</span></h3><p>In March 2022, Austen stated that fans will see 16 episodes this season.
