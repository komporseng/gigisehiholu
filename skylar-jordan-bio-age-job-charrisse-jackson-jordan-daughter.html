Well, the then-freshman featured on </span><i><span>RHOP</span></i><span> alongside her mother has now graduated from </span><i><span>Spelman College</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>But that’s not the only thing you missed about her. Keep reading this Skylar Jordan Bio to learn everything about Charrisse’s daughter.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Skylar Jordan, RHOP Star Charrisse Jackson-Jordan Daughter</b></h3><p><span>Skylar Jordan and her mother Charrisse Jackson-Jordan are more friends than mom-daughter.</span></p><p><span>According to Skylar, she even often forgot that her mother was not her age, and so did Charrisse. However, for the </span><i><span>RHOP</span></i><span> star forgetting her age was international.</span></p><p><span>Wishing Skylar the best and confessing her wish to be young (prior to Skylar’s graduation day), Charrisse wrote on IG, “Can’t believe my baby and our besties (okay her besties- I’m always trying to be young 😂) are graduating next month.”</span></p><p><span>If you’ve been a long-time fan of </span><i><span>Real Housewives of Potomac</span></i><span> then you should know that Skylar joined </span><i><span>Spelman College</span></i><span> back in 2018. She was featured being dropped off by her mother at the college then.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, before Skylar headed back to Potomac, Charrisse made sure that her daughter’s dorm room was nothing short of perfect. A white, blush, and gold color schemed dorm room even had a pair of super fluffy-looking slippers to match Skylar’s blush accent pillow and rug.</span></p><p><span>But this wasn’t the first time Charrisse spoiled her daughter. The RHOP star taking Skylar on dates and buying her the clothes she desired is nothing new to viewers.</span></p><p><span>To summarize, Charrisse loved Skylar to the moon. She was there to drop Skylar off at school and was there when she graduated. “I am probably the proudest mother alive to have a daughter that is so caring, intelligent, spiritual, has high standards and ambitions, and is overall a good person that makes loving her so easy,” the RHOP star praised her daughter on her graduation day.</span></p><h3><b>Does Skylar Jordan Have A Sibling?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Skylar Jordan has two older siblings named Jackson (Skylar’s firstborn, birthday: March 21) and Justin.</span></p><p><span>Her brother, Jackson was a basketball athlete who played for </span><i><span>Southern New Hampshire University</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, Jackson was often the star of Skylar’s socials.

Why? Well, Eddie made it clear that if Charrisse was going to join </span><i><span>Real Housewives of Potomac</span></i><span>, they would get a divorce. And Charrisse did!</span></p><p><span>“Needless to say, I took that as my marriage was done.
