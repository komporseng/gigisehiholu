It’s also unclear what this would mean for Gibson’s future on the series. While she reportedly did film scenes for series 15 late last year, Gibson also hinted in a recent interview that she had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">completed her time on Doctor Who</a> and that she would begin auditioning for new roles in 2024.</p><p>“I think, now that the strike’s over, probably auditioning again, for parts, and seeing what’s out there,” Gibson told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fabric magazine</a>. “Every year has seen such change for me, it’s hard to think what might come next. I’d like to play a villain… If not that I think I’m really intrigued by biopic roles that you really need to research. I think that would be a great challenge. I don’t know, I think I’m just excited to see what’s to come.”</p><p>Time will tell when we’ll be saying goodbye to Ruby Sunday and welcoming a new companion to the show. What we do know is that the mystery surrounding Ruby’s origin will be the focus of series 14, which also has a few other questions to answer. What the heck is going on with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anita Dobson’s Mrs. Flood</a>? And who is in possession of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the gold tooth</a> containing the Master? With any luck, Russell T Davies won’t keep us waiting for the answers for too much longer.</p><p><a href=#>Danofgeek</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toppWserG0zq2mrGWWp7yuedKnprBlp522tbGMrJytZZeew6Z5xaKprKxdobywt4yaq2aqkZi1priMs5ygpJWneqq6jJymrKylorJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
