This particular species is a small, deep-sea octopus that is rarely captured on film.</p><p>Nearly all of the animals were in a brooding position on the rocks. This is a common position for female octopuses where they turn their bodies inside-out and invert their arms to cover and protect their eggs.</p><p>“This has never been discovered on the West Coast of the U.S., never in our sanctuary and never in the world with these numbers,” King <a href=# rel=noopener>added</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-195438 alt="Octopuses Brooding California" width=900 height=478 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/octopuses-brooding-california.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-195438 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>YouTube</span><span class=caption-body>Footage taken on the Exploration Vessel Nautilus of the Muusoctopus robustus octopus nursery.</span></p><p>This is only the second time on record that scientists have observed a deep-sea octopus nursery.

However, the crew was unable to confirm this theory because the Nautilus wasn’t equipped with temperature probes at the time.</p><p>A return trip and a wide range of new research will need to be conducted on the nursery and the octopuses before researchers will be able to give definitive answers to lingering questions. However, this remarkable video serves as another reminder about just how little we know about our oceans’ depths.</p><p>Next, take a look at the astounding <a href=#>mimic octopus</a>, the impersonator extraordinaire of the deep sea.
