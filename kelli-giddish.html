She gets her protein from lean meat, and she gets a lot of fiber and nutrients from fruits and vegetables. She usually begins her day with a black omelet and coffee. She’ll then have some fruit to keep her going until lunch. For lunch and dinner, she’ll have fish or chicken with pasta or rice and a vegetable salad.
