She stars in the Vogue June 2021 issue, sporting fashion from the mid-20th century.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Billie Eilish’s Blonde Hair</h2><p>Eilish had been sporting her jet black and lurid green hair for the past eighteen months. She dyed her hair blonde, and the transformation broke the internet.</p><p>Aside from becoming the fastest post to reach a million likes, her photo also became the third most-liked picture ever in just two days.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The ‘Ocean Eyes’ singer’s decision to go blonde has resulted in countless imitations, further fueling the summer’s hottest hair color trend, “reel blonde.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Vogue’s cover story covered the process in greater detail, outlining that it took four&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dye sessions</a>&nbsp;to change her hair. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>British Vogue Cover Star</h2><p>Billie Eilish stars in the June 2021 issue of British Vogue.</p><p>Her Vogue photoshoot embraces the theme of classic pin-up and is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inspired</a>&nbsp;by former bodybuilder and iconic pin-up girl Betty Brosmer, German-American fashion photographer Horst P. Horst, and the pioneer of artful stocking and leg photographer Elmer Batters. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>One reason that drew Eilish to corsets other than their designs, shapes, and lacings were their original restrictive function. She honestly added that she was insecure about her stomach.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Body Positivity</h2><p>Eilish has often been hailed as an icon of body positivity, however, her views regarding the subject differ from the mainstream notions. And in her Vogue cover interview, she expanded on her thoughts.</p><p>It’s all about what makes you feel good. If you want to get surgery, go get surgery. If you want to wear a dress that somebody thinks you look too big wearing, **** it — if you feel like you look good, you look good.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Tattoo</h2><p>One item that Eilish had on her bucket list was getting a tattoo. She revealed in 2020 that she had fulfilled her wish of getting inked, while also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stating</a> that her fans would never get to see it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Your Power</a>’ singer showed off her body art in one of her photos for the Vogue photoshoot. While the tattoo isn’t crystal clear, people have assumed that it’s a slithering dragon design. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The tattoo covers a good portion of her upper thigh and extends to her midriff.</p><h2>Happier Than Ever</h2><p>Eilish is <a href=# rel=follow>releasing</a> her second album titled Happier Than Ever on July 30. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">teased</a> her new project on April 26 with a short snippet of her singing “When I’m away from you, I’m happier than ever.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>As evident by her transformation, her second album will be much brighter than her first album, which had a dark and haunting theme. Eilish <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">expressed</a> her excitement for the album, stating that it was her favorite creation to date.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmHyjtculoJ5llZ65qr%2FHZpmonKlitaK10WatqJ%2Blmnqku9WeqWarpKS%2FunrHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
