The stunning mom of one is the queen of red carpets, and she’s become a pro at looking sexy AND classy at the same time. She’s also a fitness guru — she even has her own line, Calia by Carrie — and is not shy about showing off the results of her workouts on Instagram once in a while. While Carrie has maintained a ‘good girl’ image in her years since winning&nbsp;American Idol in 2005, she also knows how to up the sexy factor when needed, and to celebrate her big day, we’ve rounded up her hottest photos in the gallery above!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Unfortunately, in recent months, we haven’t seen much of Carrie. The singer fell outside her home in November, and revealed at the beginning of 2018 that her injuries were pretty horrific. She actually had to have 40-50 stitches put in her face afterward, and warned her fans that she might look a bit different when she decides to show herself in public again. So, instead of attending public events and over-posting on social media, Carrie has been staying under the radar and recovering quietly. She&nbsp;has posted a few photos of herself in recent months, but has been careful to cover up the lower and left half of her face in all of them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>One photo of Carrie’s full face&nbsp;has surfaced online, though. In December, before she even opened up about her facial injuries, she met&nbsp;Below Deck star,&nbsp;<strong>Adrienne Gang</strong>, at a gym and they snapped a pic together. After learning about the accident, Adrienne shared her photo with Carrie on social media, and admitted she didn’t notice anything different about her face.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Carrie has not released an album since 2015’s&nbsp;Storyteller, so fans are anxiously waiting for new music — hopefully this will be the year!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH10e5BpZpyZoqe2pnnUp5ueqqekvKV5waKpraCUlsZuv8SxoJ6rpGK9qbvTqKpmnZdmhXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
