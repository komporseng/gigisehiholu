However, there comes a time in everyone's life when they must settle down.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>It seems like the time might have come for Cheryl as she recently got engaged to her longtime boyfriend. Cheryl, who turns the heat up with her hot chemistry with her&nbsp;co-worker, has finally found a suitable companion.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Professional Commitment; Shares Chemistry With Onscreen Husband</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Cheryl Scott is&nbsp;working&nbsp;on ABC 7's top-rated 10 PM newscast since 1 August 2016.
