This group, to which I am specifically referring, is made up of a number of women who decided to embark on a holiday with thirteen strangers, which turned out to be the most fortunate choice. Not only was the vacation everything and more than I could have imagined, but it also made us feel like sisters from all over the world.</p><p>We have experienced life events together in the past, such as marriage, childbirth, and promotions; today, we are sharing the feeling of loss. Travels will never be the same, but every single one of them will always carry the spirit of Kimmeh Bacon with them. I took a leap a few years ago and traveled to Nashville with a group of women who have since become some of my best friends.</p><p>We spend a lot of time together, talk frequently, and laugh a lot, but today we are more dependent on one another as we bid our sister farewell. We all really miss you, Kim, and our little group just isn’t the same without you. Bacon Kimmeh That you were able to take advantage of everything the world had to offer before being compelled to leave it makes me extremely happy.</p><p>I hope you are enjoying the most thrilling journey of your life up there, and I appreciate everything you have done. You have always loved angel wings, and now you have wings that will never fall off. In addition to giving my brother a hearty embrace on my behalf, I pray that you find serenity in heaven.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwt8impJ6gXZeupLvNZqaboaSqrrPFjKeYrKCmnrmtsYytpWaeop6yr7DSZpinnF2brq61y7Jkpqelp7u0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
