The indoor pool, in particular, captured the interest of researchers. As the institute states in the Facebook post, the floor of the pool is “laid with a very well-preserved mosaic, with geometric motifs, worked with marble, stone, glass, and ceramic tiles.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-489709 alt="Roman Villa Head" width=800 height=992 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/roman-villa-head.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-489709 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Albania’s National Institute of Cultural Heritage</span><span class=caption-body>A decorative head found at the site.</span></p><p>Nearby, archaeologists unearthed two shallow bathtubs covered with waterproofing mortar. Elsewhere at the site, excavations revealed a large, brick floor and several walls, which the institute notes may have once been part of a two-story bathhouse. Scattered among the finds were more fragments of walls, ceilings, and tile mosaics.</p><p>Of these various fragments, many were adorned with motifs, both anthropomorphic and floral. The excavation also revealed a rainwater drainage channel made of ceramic tiles.</p><h2>A Glimpse Into The Life Of Ancient Albania</h2><p>Archaeologists dated the tiles to between the first and fourth centuries C.E., making the site roughly 1,600 years old. The institute believes the peak period of development was around the second century and that the villa containing the pool was likely destroyed by an earthquake in the fourth century, based on archaeological findings and ancient sources.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-489708 alt="Ancient Bathtubs" width=800 height=983 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ancient-bathtubs.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-489708 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Albania’s National Institute of Cultural Heritage</span><span class=caption-body>Ancient bathtubs found near the indoor pool.</span></p><p>Durrës was a prominent gateway between the East and West in the ancient world. It is Albania’s oldest economic and historic center, once known to the Greeks as “Dyrrhachium,” or “the city between the two hills.” The Greeks colonized the city around 672 B.C.E., and it was then taken over by the Romans around 230 B.C.E.</p><p>While excavations at the site are still ongoing, this unique discovery offers a new and exciting glimpse into ancient life in the Albanian city.</p><p>After reading about this unique indoor pool found in a Roman villa in Albania, learn about <a href=#>Tirana</a>, Albania’s colorful capital. Then, go inside the story of how <a href=#>King Zog</a> of Albania survived more than 50 assassination attempts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyzu8yapWaumaG5onnApZmappmW</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
