Drew wore the same tall, light pink crown and carried a long silver wand with a shiny star at the end. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mom of two</a> even had Glinda’s lush red shoulder-length locks to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cap off her transformation</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Drew made sure to make a dramatic entrance using her acting skills. She was first seen in her dressing room in street clothes, talking to a producer and gushing, “I love Halloween, because you get to be anybody you want to be!” Then a “tornado” blew through, sweeping her away so that she eventually appeared before her studio’s socially distanced audience in a big pink ball that dissolved to show her costume.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/drew-barrymore-halloween-ap-images-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Hello, and welcome to the show.

This is going to be a very special Halloween Drew Scarrymore right here <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in the land of Oz</a>,” Drew explained, while using Glinda’s gentle accent from the iconic fantasy film. She then teased, “We’ve got a wickedly good show!” while keeping with the witch theme.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Since 2020 marks Drew’s first Halloween as a talk show host, she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>went all-in for the holiday</a>. However, several other daytime shows took a pass on costumes, as heavy events like the upcoming Nov. 3 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>presidential election</a> and the worsening COVID-19 pandemic took away some of the levity of dressing up in costumes.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Halloween 2020 in the books.

Since the Great White Way has been shut down since March <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>due to the coronavirus</a>, the show’s on-air staff featured <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>costumes from Wicked, Hamilton and Chicago</a>. The View panelists took the year off from costumes due to the nature of their more serious political discussions surrounding <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the Nov. 3 election</a>, but they did a spooky cold open in tribute to the holiday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe5JpZp2qlax6o63Rq7Cmp6Kaeqi4yKebmmWnnseivsNmpp9ln696qa3LpaawnZWjeqS70q2spp1dZ31zfIypn6isn6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
