According to reporting by Deadline, Hughes officially <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>quit&nbsp;American Housewife</a>, a comedy about a working class family living in a stuffy Connecticut neighborhood, at the conclusion of Season 4, though she did appear in the Oct. 28 premiere. The actor has claimed that the set is a "toxic environment" and that she was subject to "discrimination."

"I made the decision to leave to protect myself from that type of discrimination. As a Black woman in entertainment, I feel the responsibility to stand up for what I deserve, what we all deserve—to be treated equally. I wish the show well, and I am excited for a new chapter and to be able to pursue the opportunities ahead."</p><p>Hughes was the only Black member of the main American Housewife cast. The series stars <strong>Katy Mixon</strong> and <strong>Diedrich Bader&nbsp;</strong>as married couple Katie and Greg Otto. Comedian&nbsp;<strong>Ali Wong&nbsp;</strong>plays Katie's other best friend, Doris. Hughes did not outline specific instances of discrimination in her public statement.</p><p>For the controversial way some older series are dealing with their histories, here are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>12 TV Shows That Have Had Episodes Pulled Because of Blackface</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Carly-Hughes-and-Ali-Wong-in-American-Housewife.jpg><p>"Carly was a valued member of the cast, and we had hoped she would return to the show this season," the spokesperson told Deadline. "The concerns she raised led to positive changes to the workplace and improvements to the culture, but we respect the decision she made to move on. We wish her nothing but the best."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/American-Housewife-Cast.jpg><p>Anonymous sources told Deadline that the claims made by Hughes "triggered an extensive HR investigation by ABC Signature, which also looked into other claims from production team members." Those production team members were not identified.</p><p>The two showrunners of American Housewife, <strong>Kenny Schwartz</strong> and <strong>Rick Wiener</strong>, are still in place, but have reportedly gone through sensitivity training. Series creator and head writer <strong>Sarah Dunn</strong>, who's&nbsp;also written for&nbsp;Murphy Brown&nbsp;and&nbsp;Spin City, "is no longer an active producer on the show." A line producer,&nbsp;<strong>Mark J. Greenberg</strong>, has also "stepped down" in conjunction with the claims. None of those individuals have issued their own statements regarding the changes or Hughes's characterization of the set.</p><p>For older films that are shockingly problematic, check out <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>11 Classic '90s Movies That Have Been Called Out for Racism</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Carly-Hughes-Instagram.jpg><p>The actor posted an adorable photo of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>herself as a baby on her Instagram</a> last week.
